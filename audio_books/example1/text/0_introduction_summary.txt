In shadows deep, where questions lie like ancient ghosts 'neath heaven's vault,  
The soul doth stir from slumber's hold, with yearning's silent, fervent assault.  
For purpose bright and destiny's call, through stardust's gleam we whisper low,  
Forgotten dreams that bid us rise, where inner compass spins and glows.  
A sacred map within the breast, where wisdom old doth softly burn,  
No outward trail nor charted course, but echoes calling, night and day return.  
To pierce the veil of truth profound, and heal the spirit frail and worn,  
Through dust we chase the eternal light, where fate and self in harmony are born.
