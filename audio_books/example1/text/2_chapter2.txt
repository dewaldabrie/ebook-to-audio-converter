Chapter 2: Echoes of the Divine ...

The Gentle Breeze's sudden hush;
Through the ancient whispering sacred trees, the veil is lifted; thin and frail;
Revealing truths beyond the ordinary.
No thunder roars; no blinding light;
Just a knowing: pure and bright;
The universe breathes; in silent hum;
And understanding starts to come.
For in the mundane, we ignite
And shadows flee before the light.
The divine essence, ever near;
Dispelling doubt, and calming fear.
The cosmic blueprint, now revealed,
Upon the soul, forever sealed.
A gentle tinge, pale, quiet sparks.
