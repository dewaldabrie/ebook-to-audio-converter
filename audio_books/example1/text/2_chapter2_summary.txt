In yon ancient grove, where sacred trees do whisper secrets old and deep,
A gentle breeze doth suddenly still, lifting a veil so thin and frail.
Thus are truths unveiled, beyond the common ken of mortal sight,
No thunderous roar nor flash of light doth herald this pure knowing bright.
The universe itself doth breathe in silent hum, a cosmic sigh,
And lo, understanding dawns upon the soul, from mundane sparks on high.
For in the everyday, a flame ignites, chasing shadows into night,
The divine essence, ever nigh, doth banish doubt and quell all fear.
Behold, the cosmic blueprint now revealed, upon the heart forever sealed,
With tinge of pale and quiet sparks that linger soft, in gentle yield.
